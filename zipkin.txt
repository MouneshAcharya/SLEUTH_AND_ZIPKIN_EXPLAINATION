used for tracing purpose in distributed systems
How Spring Cloud Sleuth Works
Spring Cloud Sleuth operates by assigning a unique trace and span ID to each incoming request.

Trace ID: A unique ID assigned to each request that enters the system, which remains constant as the request travels through various services.
Span ID: Represents a basic unit of work, or a specific operation within a system, like a REST API call to a microservice. A single trace can have multiple spans as a request moves through various services and operations.

zipkin
It provides necessary tooling to monitor and analyze the journey of requests and responses across a system.

Architecture of Zipkin
Zipkin is composed of four main components:

Collector: Gathers timing data from application services. It can collect data through various means, including HTTP, Kafka, or RabbitMQ.
Storage: Once the data is collected, it is stored in a backend storage system. Zipkin supports multiple storage options, such as In-Memory, Elasticsearch, Cassandra, and MySQL.
Search: Offers robust search functionality, allowing developers to query the stored tracing data based on various parameters like service name, trace ID, or time frame.
API and Web UI: Provides a RESTful API and a Web UI for accessing the stored tracing data, visualizing trace flows, and analyzing timing data.

How Zipkin Works
Zipkin’s operation is seamless and automatic. Here’s how it works:

Services instrumented with Zipkin send timing data to the Zipkin Collector. The data includes information like the timestamp, annotation, service name, trace, and span IDs.
The Collector processes the data and stores it in the chosen backend storage.
Developers and teams can use the Web UI or API to query the stored data, visualize traces, and understand the interactions between different services in the architecture.
Visualization with Zipkin
One of Zipkin’s most valuable features is its powerful visualization capabilities. The Web UI allows developers to:

Trace Visualization: See the path that requests take through the various services in the system.
Latency Analysis: Analyze the time taken by each service to process a request, helping identify services that are potential performance bottlenecks.
Dependency Analysis: View the dependency graph between different services, providing insights into the relationships and interactions between various services in the system.

Integration with Spring Cloud Sleuth
Zipkin’s seamless integration with Spring Cloud Sleuth allows developers to correlate tracing data with application logs, providing a comprehensive view of the request flow, interactions, and performance across different services.

By leveraging the capabilities of Zipkin, developers and teams can significantly enhance their ability to monitor, analyze, and optimize their microservices architectures, leading to more robust, efficient, and performant systems.
